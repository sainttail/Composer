<p>Unfortunately, our naming convention has changed. For this reason, we need to modify our docker-compose.yml file to add these changes. Additionally, we need to rebuild our container and restart the services to ensure that these changes take effect.  Read the API endpoints documentation in the project directory to educate yourself about the available endpoints for our application and their usage. Once ready, create your first task by requesting the appropriate endpoint based on the documentation.</p>
